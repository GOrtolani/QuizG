The application support version of android from v8 to v19, to keep the backward compatibility, it need of the appcompat_7 libraries, which I included in the folder. 

If it will be impossible to import the appcompact_7 folder, just create a new project(with Eclipse updated) and redirect the path of the libraries with the one just created ( proprieties -> android -> go to the bottom of the screen remove and add the new path).

Make sure that all the libraries paths corrisponds with the one in the current systems and that both QuizTrivial and appcompat_7 folders are inside the eclips Projects folder.
